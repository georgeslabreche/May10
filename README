Up to Coverflow in the in-class examples. Try everything and do all the exercises. This app is based on this website. Write and upload a project named May10 that does something interesting. For example, make a Model object as well as a View and a Controller. Party after the last class?

Thereâ€™s all kinds of stuff you can read: view controllers in general, tab bar controllers or navigation controllers in particular. Look at tab bars, navigation bars, and modal views in the Human Interface Guidelines.

-= What this app actually does =-

It's an iPad app using split view:
- It retrieves data online from the following feed URL: http://www.vulture.com/rss/index.xml
- It parses the XML feed and categorizes vulture.com article content.
- The master view is a table view of all the article categories.
- The detail view is a table view of recently published articles from a category selected in the master view.
- Selecting an article will in the detail view's table view will load that article content into a web view. It's a web view because the content is formatted in HTML.
- There is navigation control on the detail view.
- If you rotate the device to portrait mode, the master view disappears and a navigation bar buttun appears to access an alternative menu.

-= Concepts explored =-

- UISplitViewController
- Managing hiding and showing master view when rotating device by implementing methods of the UISplitViewControllerDelegate protocol.
- Using UIBarButtonItem for a view that has UINavigationControl associated to it. This is used to access category menu when iPad is Portrait mode. 
- Parsing XML with NSXMLParserDelegate
- UIWebView and loading html content that's stored in an NSString.
- Operating on NSString to do replace or contains.

-= Concepts to explore =-

- Parsing JSON.
- Caching content already parsed instead of reparsing every time.
- Use UIPopoverController instead of UIBarButtonItem to access a category menu when the iPad is in Portrait orientation.
